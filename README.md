# Seq2seq Chatbot With Deep Reinforcement Learning

Train the conventeional seq2seq model using deep reinforcement learning.
This project is aimed to make chatbot responses more positive.

- Reward Function:
	- Sentiment Analysis Score: Trying make chatbot's response positive.
	- Coherence Score: To make response suitable for the users' input.

## Prerequisites
1. Python packages:
	- Python 3.6 or higher
	- Tensorflow r1.8 or higher
	- Numpy

2. Clone this repository:
```shell=

```

## Usage

Before training the seq2seq model with reinforcement learning, you need to pre-train the seq2seq model and sentiment analysis model.

### Sentiment Analysis Model:

1. First go to `./sentiment_analysis`

2. Download sentiment analysis dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I1HLtix-R3O2HALyDwha6N4wM2K0p0FI/view?usp=sharing) and put it in `sentiment_analyis/corpus` and rename it as `SAD.csv`

3. Run:
`python run.py`

### Pre-train seq2seq model

1. Go to `./`

2. Pre-train the seq2seq model as the coherence reward function and also as the initialization for the reinforcement learning.

3. Put the dataset in `corpus/` as input sentence dataset named `source` and output sentence named `target` (These two files should contain the same amount of dialogues)
The dialogue corpus can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/marsan-ma/chat_corpus)

Run:
`python run.py --mode MLE`

### Reinforcement Learning

After training sentiment analysis model and pre-training seq2seq model:

Run:
`python run.py --mode RL`

Program will automatically load the pre-trained models and start training seq2seq model using reinforcement learning.

### Test Model

Simply run:
`python run.py --mode TEST`

### Hyperparameters of the run.py
`--vocab_size`: the vocabulary size of the input  
`--hidden_size`: number of units of hidden layer  
`--num_layers`: numbers of the layer  
`--batch_size`: batch size  
`--mode`: mode of the seq2seq model (MLE, RL, TEST)  
`--source_data`: the path of the source file  
`--target_data`: the path of the target file  
`--model_dir`: directory of the pre-trained seq2seq model  
`--model_rl_dir`: direcory of the reinforcement learning seq2seq model  
`--check_step`: step interval of saving model  


## File in this project

### Folders:  
`corpus/`: store the training data.  
`model/`: store the pre-trained seq2seq model.
